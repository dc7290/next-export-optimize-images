# Comparison with similar libraries

It is very difficult to write this page objectively, but on the other hand I understand that it is very important for developers.

We will do our best to avoid bias and provide fair and accurate information, but if you find something wrong or inaccurate, please let us know by submitting an Issue!

## next-optimized-images

https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images

It is probably the most famous of Next.js' image optimization libraries.
Compared to our library, it has the following characteristics

- Optimize images using `webpack`'s `loader` feature.
- No need to use `next/image`

Let me list some of the disadvantages.

- Update stopped on August 9, 2020.
- Bundle size is bloated when long strings such as srcSet are needed to bundle images with webpack.

Because of the above features, we would like to compare our library with this one and recommend our library to the following users.

- **I want to use `next/image` to optimize images.**
- **I'm using `responsive-loader`, but I'm concerned about the bundle size of images.**

## next-image-export-optimizer

https://github.com/Niels-IO/next-image-export-optimizer

Since this library is very similar to ours, it would be very good for you to try this one as well.

A brief comparison with our library reveals the following characteristics for your reference.

- Specify a directory, such as `public/images`, and the images in it will be processed.

Let me list some of the disadvantages.

- Settings are somewhat complicated and cumbersome.
- All options for `next/image` are not available.
- Only one extension can be handled.

Due to the above features, `next-image-export-optimizer` is not recommended for the following users.

- Want to use it as simply as possible.
- When multiple formats of images are required to be supported by Picture component.
- I want to use `next build` to optimize images in advance while using the Node.js server.
- Remote image optimization made easy.
